/////////////////////
// So we do await getOrder, but now remember
// that this needs to receive the ID.
// So, how do we get the ID from the
// URL right into this function?
// Well, we previously used the useParams hook, right?
// So something like this. However, since this is a hook
// it only works inside components.
// It doesn't work in regular functions.

// But, luckily for us, React Router has, of course,
// thought of the situation, and therefore it passes
// in some data into the loader function as it calls it,
// and one of the properties of the object that
// the loader function receives is exactly the params.
// So, we de-structure that object here
// and get out the params.
// And so, here, we then get params.orderId
// and it is called orderId because that is
// exactly the name that we gave it here.
// { path: "/order/:orderId", element: <Order /> },
